 Helium 2.1.1
 - Bug fixes
 
 Helium 2.1
 - Update to WOW 7.2
 - Removed legacy morph spell code
 - Removed legacy trap launcher code
 - Code clean up
 - Reworked Rogues stealth bars to use the stance setting.  This should allow them shadow dance to change bars correctly.  This change will probably result in lost old style stealth layouts.
 - Added a Shadow Dance bar state for Subtlety rogues when using the "Stealth" bar state.  This allows for a separate Stealth and Shadow Dance bars to be used.  Users can opt to remap the Stealth bar to the Shadow Dance state if they want a single bar state.
 - Fix for issue where dragging a item to the bar when the editor was open would overwrite the home state macro.
 - Fixed issue where macro text would not clear between bar states.
 - Fixed some issues with flyouts not generating correctly.
 - Added flyout macro generator to the button editor window.
